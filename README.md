üìÅ **USER**

- Create a new user: `POST /api/users`
- Get all users: `GET /api/users`
- Get a single user by its `id`: `GET /api/users/:userId`

- Delete a user by its `id`: `DELETE /api/user/:userId`

üìÅ **FRIEND**

- Add a new friend to a user's friend list: `POST /api/users/:userid/friends/:friendId`
